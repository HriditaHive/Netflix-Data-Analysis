# Netflix-Data-Analysis
This project focuses on performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a Netflix dataset to uncover insights about the content like trends, genre distribution and regional patterns. By leveraging visualizations and statistical methods, this project aims to provide actionable insights that could aid in content strategy, audience targeting, and better understanding of the Netflix catalog. The analysis is carried out in Jupyter Notebook using Python 3, leveraging the capabilities of the pandas and seaborn libraries.

## Objectives
The main goals of this project are to:        
- Explore data attributes such as title, release year, type, genre, and duration.
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset to uncover key insights.
- Analyze correlations between variables.
- Draw insights that could assist in content recommendation and personalization.

## Data Source
This Netflix Dataset has information about the TV Shows and Movies available on Netflix till 2021.       
This dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine, and available on Kaggle website for free.    
It has been provided in this repository as **_Netflix Dataset.csv_** for ease of use.      
The dataset includes information on Netflixâ€™s catalog, such as titles, genres, release dates, country of origin, and content type (Movies or TV Shows). The data allows us to analyze different dimensions of Netflix's library and see how certain aspects have changed over time. 

## Project Structure
The main sections of this project include:
- Data Preprocessing: Handling duplicate values and transforming data to prepare it for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistical summaries to explore key insights and trends.
- Insight Generation: Key findings based on the analysis.
- Conclusion and Recommendations: Suggestions based on the identified patterns.

## Getting Started
To replicate this analysis, ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:  

``` pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn ```    

To clone the project:      
```
git clone <repository-url>
cd Netflix-Data-Analysis
```
